# Supervised Learning Final Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a supervised learning model to predict [specific outcome] using [specific dataset]. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics and plots.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.
