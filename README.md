# Supervised Learning Final Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a supervised learning model to predict [specific outcome] using [specific dataset]. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved trained models.
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics and plots.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Run the data preprocessing script to load and preprocess the dataset.
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Model Training:**
   Train the model using the preprocessed data.
   ```bash
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   Evaluate the trained model and save the evaluation metrics.
   ```bash
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

### Jupyter Notebooks
The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development. You can run these notebooks using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

To start Jupyter Lab:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

To start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Project Details

### Data
The dataset used in this project is located in the `data/` directory. Ensure the dataset file is named `dataset.csv`. You can replace this file with your own dataset if needed.

### Source Code
The `src/` directory contains the following scripts:

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training the supervised learning model.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model and saving the results.

### Models
The `models/` directory will store the trained models. By default, the trained model is saved as `trained_model.pkl`.

### Results
The `results/` directory contains evaluation metrics and plots generated during the model evaluation step.
